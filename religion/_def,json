  "Description": "Welcome to the Religion commons!This is a place to store information about systems of beliefs and rituals found throughout the world.UniGraph currently contains a lot of data related to religions, but much of it has not been appropriately typed or linked together. As you're adding data, lean heavily on the autocomplete feature so you can be sure you're not creating a duplicate of an already existing topic. You might also want to do some searching to see if the thing you're trying to add already exists under a different name (if so, please update the \"Also known as\" field).Click on any of the types listed here for more detailed information (Religion is a good place to start - most of the other types hang off of that one). How you can help:Here are a few things that you can do to help fill out this domain:find other religions that currently exist in the system but haven't been typed yetidentify schools and denominations associated with different religions and add them to theÂ \"Includes\" property of the appropriate Religion topic.help fill out the \"Beliefs\" and \"Practices\" properties of the religions we currently have. Please note that many of these are already in UniGraph, and just need to be typed and associated with the correct religion - autocomplete is your friend! Also, note that many belief and practices will be \"de-normalized\", i.e. shared between different denominations of the same religion. For example, many beliefs of \"Christianity\" will also appear in \"Catholicim\", \"Protestantism\" and other denominations. there are a number of topics in UniGraph about individual churches - these need to be typed (\"religious organization\") then associated with the appropriate religion.If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to post them to the discussion threads."
