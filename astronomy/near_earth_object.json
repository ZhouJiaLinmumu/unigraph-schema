    "Description": "A near-Earth object (NEO) is a Solar System object whose orbit brings it into very close proximity with the Earth. All NEOs have a perihelion distance of less than 1/3 of an AU in respect with Earth. They include a few thousand asteroids, comets, a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft, and meteoroids large enough to be tracked in space before potentially striking the Earth.",
