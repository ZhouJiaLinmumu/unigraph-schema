    "Description": "Galaxies are classified due to their visual appearance. The most commonly used is the modified Hubble sequence which was expanded upon by GÃ©rard de Vaucouleurs and Allan Sandage. Hubble proposed a division of galaxies by their gross structure: (E_) ellipticals, (S0) lenticulars, S_  SB)_spirals  and (I_) irregulars. The de Vaucouleurs system adds additional letters to further differentiate galaxies based upon the presence and structure of a Bar formation, presence or absence of a ring structure, and then a further refinement of Hubble's original sub-classification of the spiral arms of the galaxy.",
