    "Description": "This type is intended to be used with any product or brand that has ingredients. This will typically be processed foods, cosmetics, cleaning products, and the like.Â This type can be added as a co-type to consumer products or to brands, depending on the nature of the products involved. For example, a breakfast cereal is typically modeled as a brand, since different package sizes would represent the consumer product, and the ingredients for the cereal are the same no matter which size package it's in.",
