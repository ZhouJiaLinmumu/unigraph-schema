    "Description": "A consumer product is a physical item which a consumer may buy, either at present or in the past. It might be a laptop, or a chocolate bar, or a pair of sneakers. Consumer products are specific items that have a specific market price, not classes of items, which would have a wide range of prices. So an automotive model year or automotive trim level would be a consumer product, but not an automotive model. A specific smartphone like the iphone 3GS 32GB Black, would be a consumer product but not just the smartphone or even the product line iphone 3GS.",
