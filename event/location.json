    "Description": "Where this event happened; this can be in multiple locations. When deciding which location to list, it is best to use the most specific location that makes sense. E.g., for the event \"Assassination of Abraham Lincoln,\" the best location to use would be \"Ford's Theatre;\" \"Washington, DC\" would be okay, and \"United States,\" while strictly accurate, would be a poorer choice. However, for an event like the the Chinese Civil War, \"China\" would be the best location, since the event occurred throughout China.",
