    "Description": "A Musical Track is a single recorded track on a Musical Album or Musical Release typically a recording of a song, though it may be a movement of a symphony or other partial work. It should correspond to the tracks on a track listing of an LP, cassette, or CD if the track was ever on an album.A track should be a unique recording, but may appear on multiple albums or releases; for instance, an artist may release a track on one album, and then have that exact recording show up on a Greatest Hits album, a movie soundtrack, and a collection of best songs of the year. In that case, the exact same track instance should be used for each album.However, different recordings of the same song should not be considered the same track; if an artist issues an alternate take on a box set, for instance, or a version on a live album, those should be considered different tracks.",
