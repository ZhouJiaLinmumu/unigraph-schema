    "Description": "A Musical Release Component is a single physical medium that was packaged with others as part of a Multi-Part Release Package. Examples include disc 3 of a 5-CD box set, or the first LP of a 2-LP album release. Although this type includes the Musical Release type, it should not connect directly back to an album, but only to a Multi-Part Release Package. The exception is if a box set includes remasterings of an artists earlier albums, and this component is both part of a package and a release of an album.",
