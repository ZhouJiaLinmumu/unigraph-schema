  "Description": "The Music commons contains recording artists, albums, and songs. Data found here is a combination of information sourced from MusicBrainz and Wikipedia. The data currently loaded is focused on English-language popular music. We encourage you to add new artists, albums, and songs if they’re missing. This commons also contains information about keys, chords, and other music-theoretical concepts. In the coming weeks we’re planning to incorporate more structured information from Wikipedia infoboxes such as images, musical genre, origin, and record labels. At some point we may also import other data such as links to iTunes audio tracks, song lyrics, or listings of bootleg albums. If there's something you’d like to see, suggest it in the Discuss area below.Please note that albums of spoken word performances or audiobooks, though sharing some structures in common, do not belong in the Music commons. Some such have been inappropriately imported where they were not tagged correctly in MusicBrainz; please report these or un-type them as Musical Albums or their performers or authors as Musical Artists.For more see the Music Commons Documentation"
