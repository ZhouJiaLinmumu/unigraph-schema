    "Description": "A park system is a group of parks or other protected sites that are governed or considered as a whole; park systems often include parks that are located in multiple governmental jurisdictions. For example, in the United States, the National Park System includes parks, monuments, etc. in most states; regional park systems generally span several counties.
