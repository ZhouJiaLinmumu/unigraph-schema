    "Description": "\"Engineer\" is the core type for engineers of the built environment. \"Structure\" lists \"Engineer\" as a property to impart attribution. This is quite flexible: whether an engineer designed a Skyscraper (e.g. a Structural Engineer) or Bridge (e.g. a Civil Engineer) this type can be used (as the target property for \"Structure\"). You can more accurately type an Engineer with the \"co-types\": \"Civil Engineer\" or \"Structural Engineer.\"",
