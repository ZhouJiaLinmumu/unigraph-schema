    "Description": "This is a chain of hotels which are marketed together, and often share the same name (e.g. Intercontinental). It is not necessary for all the hotels in a Hotel brand to be owned and/or operated by a single company, and can instead be owned and/or operated by many different companies under a franchise contract. For example, Starwood Hotels  Resorts, a Hotel Operator, owns the Sheraton, Le Meridien and Four Points brands. An individual hotel can be part of one or more brands, but this is fairly uncommon.",
