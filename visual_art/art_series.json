Usually conceived and created as a series with a shared theme by the artist. E.g. The Four Freedoms series by Norman Rockwell.2) A grouping for convenience sake or for art criticism of one artist's individual artworks sharing a common theme. Usually not conceived as a series by the artist, and done over time. E.g.Van Gogh's Sunflowers series.In general, to avoid confusion, instances of Art Series should not be co-typed as Artwork.",
