    "Description": "This type is for people, named animals, and groups (such as bands, collectives, etc.) that have appeared in films in non-acting roles (especially in non-fictional film types such as documentaries and concert films). Animals using this type should be individual creatures, rather than just a species (for example, Koko the Gorilla could incude this type since she was the subject of a documentary film, but the classification Gorilla would not have this type).",
