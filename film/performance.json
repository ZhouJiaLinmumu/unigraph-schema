Normally this would be a direct relationship, but a mediator was needed to hold the character name. Some performances, particularly famous ones (eg. Laurence Olivier in Hamlet) can be turned into full-fledged Topics and given titles, images, articles, etc. Additionally there is the Special Performance type for performances that are non-standard (notable examples would be Motion Capture for the role of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy or Voice or Seiyu for animated/foreign films )",
